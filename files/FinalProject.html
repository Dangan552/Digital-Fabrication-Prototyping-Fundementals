					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>In this webpage I will be documenting my final project: <b>The Cardshuffler</b>. I've always liked to play card games and since coming to poly, I
					my friends and I started to play them at every opportunity. So I decided to build a card shuffler as my project and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZQxxR9AD74" >here</a>
					is where i got my inspiration from. In this webpage, I will give a brief desciption of the project, explain the design and fabrication process,
					what components will be used and how the project was coded. </p>

					<h2>Project Description</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>What does it do?</h3>
					<p>This is a machine used to shuffle cards. A rocker switch is used to turn on the card shuffler. A deck of cards is then split in half and each placed onto a loading platform.
					When a pushbutton is pressed, Continuous Servo Motors under each platform spins and shuffles the half decks into the middle chamber.
					The cards may then be extracted via an opening on the front wall of the card shuffler.</p>
					<img src="../images/FinalProjectImg/Works.jpg" alt="Works" width="700" height="400">
					<h3>What are its features?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>2 Continuous Servo Motors to shuffle cards</li>
						<li>2 Loading platforms for half a deck of cards each</li>
						<li>Middle chamber for cards to fall into</li>
						<li>A Rocker Switch to on and off the shuffler</li>
						<li>A Psuh Button to start and stop the shuffling</li>

				 <h3>Card Shuffler Frame</h3>
				 <p>Here are the parameters used for the Card Shuffler Frame using the <b>parameters</b> function:</p>
				 <img src="../images/FinalProjectImg/CFD1.jpg" alt="Card Shuffler Frame Design 1" width="900" height="280">
				 <p>Next are the sketches for the base and front sides of the box. The teeth are sketched using the <b>rectangle</b> command and dimensioned using <b>Blen/ NSeg</b>.
				 The <b>rectangular pattern</b> is used as a shortcut to get the correct amount of teeth. The settings are set as <b>Distance Type: Spacing</b>, <b>1st Quantity: NSeg</b> and <b>Distance: BLen</b>.
				 The teeth are then constrained using a series of <b>coincident</b> and <b>collinear</b> constraints.</p>

				 <p>Please note that the tinkercad simulation <b>does not have</b> continuous servos motor and thus a standard <b>180 degree servo motor</b> was used.</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li><b>90 degrees = stop</li>

				 </ul>
				 <h3>Code</h3>
				 <p>The coding of the cardshuffler was relatively simple. The only library needed was the <b>Servo library</b> to program the continous servos. Some things
					to take note is that <b>sv1</b> rotates in the <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction whilst <b>sv2</b> rotates in the <b>clockwise</b> direction. The <b>delay</b>
					must also be less than <b>1000ms</b> or else too many cards on one side will not be shuffled.</p>

				 <h2>Power Supply</h2>
				 <p>A good project should be portable and possess an internal power supply as it is very cumbersome for it to be powered by the computer.
				 I decided to use a power supply of 6V via 4 AA batteries in a 4x AA battery holder. A rocker switch is also used to on and off the arduino in the shuffler.
			   The power supply is then connected to the arduino's external power supply port via a barrel jack.</p>

				 <h2>Assembly & Troubleshooting</h2><br>
				 <h3>Assembly</h3>
				 <p>After fabricating all the frame and wheels of the cardshuffler, acquiring the servo motors and testing them out, I moved on to assembling my project to see
				 whether the shuffling concept of my project was successful. I used <b>bluetack</b> to stick my 5cm wheels to the servo horn and placed some <b>rubber bands</b> around the wheels to give it more
			   <b>friction to grip the cards</b>. I then <b>soldered</b> all the wires connected to the toggle switch and the powersource.</p>
				 <img src="../images/FinalProjectImg/Parts.jpeg" alt="Parts" width="450" height="400">
				 <video width=710px src="../images/FinalProjectImg/Assembly.mp4" controls></video>
				 <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
				 <p>I initially thought that the angle of card feed was insufficient as I was worried that the cards would not be able to fall into the shuffling chamber
				 with a 90 degree loading platform. My worries were put to rest though as the cards were partialy shuffled shuffled. Unfortunately, I encountered quite a few problems with the machine.</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li> The cardshuffler jam at the start of the cycle as the <b>motors are not aligned properly</b>. The tolerance from the motor holder allow the motors to be slanted leading the cards to be <b>fed at an oblique angle</b>,
					 jamming them against the front or back walls.</li>
					 <li>The last few cards tended to jam the machine as the back edges of the cards got stuck in the <b>feeding slit</b>. Some cards would fall into the chamber halfway of both sides cause a <b>"V"</b> shape to form.</li><hr>

					 <li>The <b>"V"</b> shaped obstruction could in turn cause another problem by forming a <b>"bridge"</b> of cards preventing the rest of the cards from falling downwards.</li>
					 <li>After soldering all the wires together for the toggle switch and powersource, there was not enough space to slot the button into its pre designed hole. Placing the powersource on the ground also jams the 5cm wheel

				 <p>After much thought, I came up with a few solutions to address the issues I encountered. The first was to <b>file down the edges</b> of the <b>loading platforms and chamber walls</b>.
				 This would allow the cards to slide smoother through the card slit to prevent them from jamming and forming the <b>"V"</b> shape and <b>"bridge"</b> obstructions. The next solution was to <b>fill up
			   the gaps</b> left by the tolerances of the motor holder with <b>bluetack</b>. This would prevent the motors from slanting and feeding the cards into the walls. In regards to the toggle button beign unable to fit,
			   I used a saw to <b>cut a thin line from the edge of the left wall to the hole</b>. This allowed me to slide the wires in saving me the time to resolder my powersource and switch. Lastly, I used double sided tape to
			   stick the powersource to the front wall to prevent it from intefering with the 5cm wheel.</p>

				 <h2>Final Product</h2>
				 <p>After much time and effort spent on this project, I was able to finally complete it with spectacular results. Though the card shuffler takes around 10 seconds to shuffle the cards, it gets the job done.
				 I will be sure to use this cardshuffler when playing cards with my friends in the future! If you want a link to a short descriptive slide and video, click <a href = "../images/OthersImg/slide.png" >here</a> for the slide
				 and <a href = "../images/OthersImg/Presentation.mp4" >here</a> for the video! If not, I hope you keep enjoying my website!</p>
