					<h2>Profile</h2>
					<p>Hullo, my name is Daniel Gan and I am a Year 2 student studying Mechatronics & Robotics (DMRO). I've dabbled
					a bit in robotics when I was younger but the main reason why I chose this this course was due to my hobby of building
					plastic model kits (mainly Gundam). I enjoy the mechanical and coding aspects of robotics and thus decided to try out
					this Digital Prototyping elective. In my free time I also like to read some webnovels and play some computer games. When
					hanging out with friends we tend to play a lot of card games which is how I got the idea of my project.
