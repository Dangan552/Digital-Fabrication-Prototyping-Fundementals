					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Computer Aided Design or CAD is using computer software such as <a href = "https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP</a>,
					<a href = "https://inkscape.org/" >Inkscape</a>, and <a href = "https://www.autodesk.com.sg/products/fusion-360/overview" >Fusion 360</a>
					to aid in a design process. These software can be used to create 2D drawings or 3D models and are often used by engineerings to visualize
					the construction of their products. In this webpage, I will be going through some basic tutorials using of the aforementioned softwares.</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>2D Design</h2>
					<p>2D designs are used for laser cutting and engraving and can be split into two categories, raster and vector.
					Raster images are defined by pixels and the quality of a raster image depends on the number of pixels it has. Vector images on the
					other hand are created by lines defined through the use of mathematics. The software GIMP is used for the former while Inkscape
				  is used for the latter.</p>

					<h3>2D Raster</h3>
					<p>I will be demonstrating a simple use of the GIMP software on how to remove the background of an image and switch it with another
					using the images of a <a href = "../images/CADImg/727.jpg" >plane</a> and a <a href = "../images/CADImg/storm.jpg" >stormy sky</a>.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Choose an image and open it in GIMP.</li>
						<li>Go to the <b>Layers</b> tab, select <b>Transperancy</b> and click on <b>Add Alpha Channel</b> to allow the layer to have transperancy.</li>
						<li>Use the <b>Free Select Tool</b> and trace out the image of the plane.</li>
						<li>Go to the <b>Select</b> tab and click on <b>Invert</b> so that the background is now selected.</li>
						<li>Go to the <b>Edit</b> tab and click on clear to delete the background.</li>
						<li>Use the <b>Smudge Tool</b> to make the edges of the plane to make it look more natural and when done, save the image.</li>
						<br>

						<img src="../images/CADImg/RasCol2.jpg" alt="Raster2" width="600" height="400">
						<li>Choose your new background image, open it in another tab.</li>
						<li>Go to <b>File</b> and click on <b>Open as Layers</b> to open the saved copy of the plane.</li>
						<li>Scale your the image of the plane to fit into your new background.</li>
						<li>Make sure that your plane layer is onto of the background layer.</li>

					<h2>3D CAD</h2>
					<p>3D CAD is mostly used for 3D printing or computer aided machining. </p>
